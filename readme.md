## 🚀 Problem Statement

Diabetes is one of the fastest-growing lifestyle diseases worldwide.
Early risk detection and personalized preventive guidance can significantly reduce long-term complications.

However:
- Many people ignore early risk indicators
- Preventive awareness is low
- Health advice is often generic and not personalized
- PreventAI aims to bridge this gap using Machine Learning + AI guidance.
